# Stytch Client for Elixir

[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Documentation-4B275F?logo=elixir&logoColor=white)](https://togethercomputer.github.io/stytch-elixir)

_Wrapper and interface for the Stytch B2B SaaS authentication API in Elixir_

## What is this?

Together uses the [Elixir programming language](https://elixir-lang.org/) for several of its services.
It also uses [Stytch](https://stytch.com/) to serve some of its authentication and authorization needs.
This repository provides a wrapper around the Stytch B2B SaaS Authentication API in Elixir.

This repository is a work in progress and not necessarily meant for public consumption.

## Usage

This library is not currently available on Hex.pm, so install it via GitHub and run `mix deps.get`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:stytch, github: "togethercomputer/stytch-elixir", branch: "main"}
  ]
end
```

### Configuration

Stytch's API uses a _project ID_ and _secret_ for authentication.
If your application only interacts with a single project, you can provide these as the default auth for all requests:

```elixir
config :stytch, :default_auth,
  {
    "project-live-...",
    "secret-live-..."
  }
```

If your application interacts with more than one project, these auth details must be provided in each operation call:

```elixir
Stytch.Organizations.search(%{}, auth: {"project-live-...", "secret-live-..."})
```

The client will automatically switch between the test and live API based on the provided project ID and secret.

### JWT Verification

If your application uses Stytch-provided session JWTs for session management, this library can assist with verification.
See `Stytch.JWKS` for more information.

## Code Generation

At the time of writing, Stytch does not publish an OpenAPI description for their API.
A hand-crafted description [is available](vendor/stytch-openapi.yml) in this repository.
It was generated based on a public Postman collection and enhanced by hand â€” so don't expect full coverage of the API.

Code generation provided by the [OpenAPI Generator for Elixir](https://github.com/aj-foster/open-api-generator).
